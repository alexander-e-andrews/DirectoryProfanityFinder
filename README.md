# About
This is a simple project that explores a file directory, looking for profanities
and shows where they happen.
I built this tool as I often print('profanity') when debugging, and they should be removed before submission

# How to Run
pip install profanity-check   
Add any folders or files to ignore to ignore.setting   
Add file type endings to accepted.settings   
Run main.py and enter the directory you wish to explore, this should be your project directory

In Visual Studio, ctrl + click to directly follow links

# TO DO
1. Figure out magic library, but does reduce mobility, or find alternative
2. Test reading and analysing strategies
